 each is a service with own config file and uses own credentials.

 They take in data as XML or IDX and create the Content Engine.  Can it take data as JSON?  No, but LUA script can convert it.


STOP words - we can edit this dictionary.  Words to be removed.  Is this just removing words to be crawled?  Yea, kinda, lol.

STEM words - we can edit this as well.  How does this work?

The Content engine is the main service.
